# GO-SK Job board app

I am looking for a role in korea so i started a side-project with the aim of helping others find jobs too.

## Aim
create a place where companies can host job postings and users can find roles.

## Outcome
This was fully finished in an MVP state as it allowed for posting jobs, viewing roles and applying (link out to an external posting)

## Current state
This project currently still functions but the database is no longer in operation due to a change in the hosting providers pricing scheme.
